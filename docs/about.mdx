# About This Site

:::note
Since this site is a preserved version of the docs I've been working on for two years, this page is a bit different from the official version.
:::

LOC Documentation is built and customized with [Docusaurus 3.x](https://docusaurus.io/) with the Logic Code Generator built with [React 18.x](https://react.dev/), [@monaco-editor/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@monaco-editor/react) and [@rollup/browser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/browser), etc.

FST Network was a young, alive startup with an awesome working atmosphere when I joined in April 2022. The product itself is indeed a technological feat, and I did believe that it can become something useful for enterprises. I wrote documentations, technical marketing materials as well as workaround features.

Unfortunately, with only a few sales landed, we had our first layoff in Dec 2022. The situation didn't improved much over the next year, and the final straw came in June 2024. I was asked to stay (again) but decided to quit. With the product development stranded in a serious financial crisis, there was clearly nothing I can help anymore.

This site here are therefore archived as the tribute for my two years' work at FST Network.
