:::note

Since this site is an archived version of the docs I've been working on for two years, this page is a bit different from the [official version](https://documentation.loc.fst.network/). (I think the official site domain is down though.) This docs, containing more than 300 pages over 6 product releases, was the refined and combined successor of [Studio Guidebook](https://hackmd.io/@fstnetwork/BJboZp8Bc), [CLI Guidebook](https://hackmd.io/@fstnetwork/HyVeXrvIc) and [Agent List](https://hackmd.io/Uj-tC7l9Q82VyGr8R5PL2Q#Agent-List) that I've helped to create upon joining.

[FST Network](https://www.fst.network/) was a young, alive startup. The product itself is indeed a technological feat, and the management-level people and most devs were friendly, motivated and open-minded to work with. As a member of the product team, I worked with devs to write up docs, including code examples. I was often one of the first people get to test new releases, and would work with devs to improve SDK interfaces or catch bugs where the test cases can't. (Mind you, our product manager, who was not an actual management-level manager, never bothered to provide much other than the initial design docs. The SDK specs were often left blank - we patched the C# SDK issues just in time before its UAT began.)

I maintained and deployed this site as a one-man front-end project. I developed a React-based code template and unit test tool ([Logic Code Generator](/logic-code-generator)) to make everyone's logic programming process easier. I created marketing materials, including illstrations, for project managers and the marketing manager. I did market research and produce competitive product analysis for my manager, the Chief Product Officer. I assisted reworking the layout of the company website. I wrote sample logic, tutorial, workaround features and occasionally feature proposals by request. My co-workers also often asked me to help them debugging their logic code (apparently I was good at it). And, last but not least, I was the one re-discovered the Data Mesh product alignment buried in the older company documents, and wrote up an article before someone asked me about it.

Unfortunately, the company only managed to land a few sales, despite sales pitches were generally well-received. We had our first layoff in Dec 2022 (and moved to a cheaper office) and then again in Jun 2024. The last big update was at least 3 months behind the delivery schedule. With the fund exhausted and almost all developers left, the product development was thus stranded beyond hope. I was asked to stay (again) but decide to quit as well.
