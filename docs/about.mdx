# About This Site

Since this site is a preserved version of the docs I've been working on for two years, this page is a bit different from the official version.

<div className="center-padded">

        src={require("/img/about/teams.jpg").default}
        width="75%"
        alt="teams"

FST Network was a young, busy startup with an awesome working atmosphere when I joined it in April 2022. The product - LOC - is indeed a technological feat itself, and I have worked alongside developers as well as sale people to write both technical and marketing materials, including this site, which replaced the earlier, cruder user's guide I also helped to write. 

Unfortunately, we never landed enough sale deals, and we had our first layoff in Dec 2022. Over half of the dev department was cut, and we had to move to a smaller office. The situation didn't improved much over the next year, and the second layoff came in June 2024. I was asked to stay (again), but decided to quit. With the product development stranded and the company stuck in a even more serious financial situation, it was time to leave.

This site with its repository are hence archived as the tribute of my two years' work in FST Network.
