:::note

This site is the archived version of the [official one](https://documentation.loc.fst.network/). This docs, containing more than 300 pages over 6 product releases, was the refined and combined successor of [Studio Guidebook](https://hackmd.io/@fstnetwork/BJboZp8Bc), [CLI Guidebook](https://hackmd.io/@fstnetwork/HyVeXrvIc) and [Agent List](https://hackmd.io/Uj-tC7l9Q82VyGr8R5PL2Q#Agent-List) that I've helped to create upon joining.

[FST Network](https://www.fst.network/) was a young, alive startup. The product itself is indeed a technological feat, and the management-level people and most devs were friendly, motivated and open-minded to work with. As a member of the product team, I worked with devs to write up docs, including code examples and tutorials. I was also one of the first people get to test new releases, and helped improving SDK interfaces or catch app bugs where the test cases can't. (Mind you, our product manager, who was not an actual management-level manager and did not manage the dev team either, seldom bothered to provide any docs beyond the initial design.)

I maintained and deployed this site as a one-man front-end project. I developed a React-based code template and unit test tool ([Logic Code Generator](/logic-code-generator)) to make everyone's logic programming process easier. That's not all; I created marketing materials for project managers and the marketing team. I did market research and write up competitive product analysis for my manager, the Chief Product Officer. I assisted reworking the layout of the company website. I wrote workaround solutions and occasionally feature proposals by my manager's request. I often asked to help non-dev people for debugging their logic code (apparently I was good at it). And, I was the one re-discovered the Data Mesh product alignment buried in the older company documents - and produced an article before someone asked me about it.

Unfortunately, the company only managed to land a few sales, despite sales pitches were generally well-received. We had our first layoff in Dec 2022 (with the dev team cut down to half a dozen and moved to a cheaper office) and then again in Jun 2024. The last big update was at least 3 months behind the delivery schedule. With the fund exhausted and almost all developers left, the product development was thus stranded beyond hope. I was asked to stay (again) but decide to quit as well.
