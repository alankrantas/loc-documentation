# About This Site

Since this site is a preserved version of the docs I've been working on for two years, this page is a bit different from the official version.

<div className="center-padded">

        src={require("/img/about/teams.jpg").default}
        width="75%"
        alt="teams"
    />

FST Network was a young, busy startup with an awesome working atmosphere when I joined it in April 2022. The product itself is indeed a technological feat and looked promising back then. I worked alongside developers and sale people to write both technical and marketing materials.

Unfortunately, we never landed enough sale deals, and we had our first layoff in Dec 2022. Over half of the dev department was cut, and we had to move to a smaller office.

The situation didn't improved much over the next year, and the second layoff came in June 2024. I was asked to stay (again), but decided to quit. With the product development left stranded and the company stuck in a serious financial situation, it was time to leave.

As my pride and joy of these two years, this site with its repository will be archived. Maybe one day FST Network will survive and thrive again. But we shall never know here.
