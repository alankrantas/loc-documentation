# About This Site

Since this site is a preserved version of the docs I've been working on for two years, this page is a bit different from the official version.

FST Network was a young, busy startup with an awesome working atmosphere when I joined it in April 2022. The product is indeed a technological feat itself, and it did looked promising back then. I've learned so much from the devs, especially I had no prior experiences in modern software development.

Unfortunately, we never landed any sale deals after the first one (first one was also almost an disaster), and we had our first layoff in Dec 2022. Over half of the dev department was cut, and we had to move to a smaller office.

The situation didn't improved over the next year, and the second layoff came in June 2024. I was asked to stay (again), but decided to quit instead. With the rest of the devs leaving, the product development would be left stranded, and the company was already deep in a financial crisis. It was time to leave and find my way out.

Still, I wish good luck to the company and the devs/sales colleagues I've worked with. It was still a good memory and such a kick-ass experience.
