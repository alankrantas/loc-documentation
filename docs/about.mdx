# About This Site

Since this site is a preserved version of the docs I've been working on for two years, this page is a bit different from the official version.

FST Network was a young, busy startup with an awesome working atmosphere when I joined it in April 2022. The product itself is indeed a technological feat and looked promising back then.

Unfortunately, we never landed any sale deals after the first one, and had our first layoff in Dec 2022. Over half of the dev department was cut, and we've moved to a smaller office.

The situation didn't improved much over the next year, and the second layoff came in June 2024. I was asked to stay (again), but decided to quit instead. With the product development left stranded and the company stuck in a deeper financial crisis, it was time to leave and find my way out.

Still, I wish good luck to the company and the devs/sales colleagues I've worked with. It was still a good memory and such a kick-ass experience.
