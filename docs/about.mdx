:::note

Since this site is an archived version of the docs I've been working on for two years, this page is a bit different from the [official version](https://documentation.loc.fst.network/). (I think the official site is now down though. And I'm still upgrading the Docusaurus packages out of habit.)

FST Network was a young, alive startup when I joined. The product itself is indeed a technological feat, and the management-level people are friendly, motivated and open-minded to work with. I wrote docs as well as technical and marketing materials. Unfortunately, the company only managed to land a few sales, despite sales pitches were mostly well-received. We had our first layoff in Dec 2022 (and had to move to a cheaper office) and then again in Jun 2024. With the fund exhausted and almost all developers left, the product development was thus stranded beyond hope. I was asked to stay (again) but decide to quit as well.

This docs is the refined and combined successor of [Studio Guidebook](https://hackmd.io/@fstnetwork/BJboZp8Bc), [CLI Guidebook](https://hackmd.io/@fstnetwork/HyVeXrvIc) and [Agent List](https://hackmd.io/Uj-tC7l9Q82VyGr8R5PL2Q#Agent-List) that I've also helped to write and maintain. The website itself is built with `React`-based [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), in which I also developed a code template tool and unit test [Logic Code Generator](/logic-code-generator) on my own.
