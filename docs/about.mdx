# About This Site

:::note

This site is an archived version of the [official one](https://documentation.loc.fst.network/), which is no longer accessible by early 2025.

I am also [currently open to work](https://www.cake.me/krantas), either full or part-time. I can see there are some direct traffic - don't you want to hire someone who can write an awesome software documentation like this?

[FST Network](https://www.fst.network/) was a young, alive startup when I joined. The product itself is indeed a technological feat (the backend was completely written in Rust), and the management-level people and most devs were friendly, motivated and open-minded to work with. (In case you'd like to know, the product manager, who joined the company later than I was, was not one of the management-level.)

I built this site as the refined and combined successor of early docs that I've helped to create with the marketing department: [Studio Guidebook](https://hackmd.io/@fstnetwork/BJboZp8Bc), [CLI Guidebook](https://hackmd.io/@fstnetwork/HyVeXrvIc) and [Agent List](https://hackmd.io/Uj-tC7l9Q82VyGr8R5PL2Q#Agent-List). This is basically my one-man front-end project, resulted in 300+ pages over 6 LOC Core releases.

Most of the docs are written in Markdown with Mermaid illustrations. The framework is Docusaurus (React.js-based) and I did developed a React component as a logic code template generator/unit tester (which uses Rollup to bundle a mocked logic runtime), since there was no way to test code easily before the last release, and it had became clear that anyone other than devs (and me) can not memorize SDK interfaces that well.

I also served various functions like supporting the product and marketing teams. Unfortunately, the company only managed to land a few sales. We had our first layoff in Dec 2022, then again in Jun 2024. The last big update, intended for one of the sales we landed, was at least 3 months behind the delivery schedule.

With the fund exhausted and almost all developers left, the product development was thus stranded beyond hope. The product still has a long way to go to be truly competitive among other data pipeline or data catalog products - and the hope was already lost. I was asked to stay (again) but decide to quit as well.

It is a tough time to quit when AI is already taking over a lot of writing jobs. But hey, quality writing never dies. Surely someday someone would realize that.
