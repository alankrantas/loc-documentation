:::note

Since this site is an archived version of the docs I've been working on for two years, this page is a bit different from the [official version](https://documentation.loc.fst.network/). (I think the official site domain is down though.)

[FST Network](https://www.fst.network/) was a young, alive startup. The product itself is indeed a technological feat (the core services are written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)), and the management-level people are all friendly, motivated and open-minded to work with. (Mind you: our "product manager" does not belong to management-level and does not manage the dev team.) As a member of the product team, I worked with devs to write up everything on this site, including code examples. I maintained and deployed this site as a front-end project. I developed a web-based code template and unit test tool ([Logic Code Generator](/logic-code-generator)) to make everyone's logic writing process easier.

I created marketing materials, including illstrations, for project managers and the marketing manager. I did market research and produce competitive product analysis for my manager, the Chief Product Officer. I wrote sample logic, tutorial and workaround product features, also help debugging logic code for whoever needed. I assisted reworking the layout of the official company site. I was also the one re-discovered the Data Mesh product alignment buried in the old company documents, and wrote up something before someone asked me about it.

Unfortunately, the company only managed to land a few sales, despite sales pitches were generally well-received. We had our first layoff in Dec 2022 (and moved to a cheaper office) and then again in Jun 2024. The last big update was at least 3 months behind the delivery schedule. With the fund exhausted and almost all developers left, the product development was thus stranded beyond hope. I was asked to stay (again) but decide to quit as well.

This docs, containing 300+ pages across 6 product releases, is the refined and combined successor of [Studio Guidebook](https://hackmd.io/@fstnetwork/BJboZp8Bc), [CLI Guidebook](https://hackmd.io/@fstnetwork/HyVeXrvIc) and [Agent List](https://hackmd.io/Uj-tC7l9Q82VyGr8R5PL2Q#Agent-List) that I've helped to write and maintain upon joining. I own the repo of this archived site (set as private) and would still update the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) packages on monthly basis.
