:::note

This site is the archived version of the [official one](https://documentation.loc.fst.network/), which is no longer accessible by early 2025.

For the source code of this site, see the [repository](https://github.com/alankrantas/loc-documentation).

I built the site with Docusaurus (a one-man frontend project) and write everything in it with Markdown/Mermaid as a Technical Marketing Writer. It contained 300+ pages over 6 product releases in the course of 2+ years, with a React.js-based code template and test tool I've developed in a few weeks.

I left the company in July 2024 after the second layoff due to financial difficulties. The product, a technological feat nevertheless, simply did not land enough sales in Taiwan domestic market to support the company further.
