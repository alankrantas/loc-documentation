# About This Site

Since this site is a preserved version of the docs I've been working on for two years, this page is a bit different from the official one.

<div className="center-padded">

        width="75%"
        alt="teams"

FST Network was a nice, young and alive startup with an awesome working environment when I joined it in April 2022. I did believe in the product (it is indeed a genuine technical achievement itself) and thought it is actually good at what it was designed for.

Unfortunately, LOC never got to sell well, and we had our first layoffs in Dec 2022. Over half of the dev department was cut and we've moved to a smaller office.

The situation didn't improved much over the next year, and the second layoffs finally came in June 2024. I was asked to stay (again), but I decided to quit then. With the rest of the devs leaving, the product development left in stranding, there was clearly very little for me to help anymore.

Still, I wish good luck to FST Network and most of the colleagues I've worked with. It was a good memory and a kick-ass experience. I've learned so much and I'll never forget about it.
