# About This Site

Since this site is a preserved version of the docs I've been working on for two years, this page is a bit different from the official version.

<div className="center-padded">

        width="75%"
        alt="teams"

FST Network was a young, busy startup with an awesome and alive working atmosphere when I joined it in April 2022. The product is actually a genuine technological feat itself, and I've worked alongside with devs and sales people to write documentation (this site you're looking at) as well as marketing materials.

Unfortunately, we never got more than a couple of sale deals, and we had our first layoffs in Dec 2022. Over half of the dev department was cut, and we had to move to a smaller office.

The situation didn't improved much over the next year, and the second layoffs came in June 2024. I was asked to stay (again), but decided to quit. With the rest of the devs leaving, the product development would be left stranded. I don't think anything I can do will change the tide, especially for the high possibility of not getting paid for the next three to six months. It was time to leave and find my next path when I still can.

Still, I wish good luck to FST Network and most of the colleagues I've worked with. It was a good memory and a kick-ass experience. I've learned so much and I'll never forget about it.
