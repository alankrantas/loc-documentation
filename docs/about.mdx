# About This Site

:::note
Since this site is a archived version of the docs I've been working on for two years, this page is a bit different from the [official version](https://documentation.loc.fst.network/).

FST Network was a young, alive startup when I joined in April 2022. The product itself is indeed a technological feat (at the helm of the dev lead, Josh Chu, then David Lee, as well as CIO Atkins Chang), and the management people (CCO Sean Chen and CPO/COO Leo Chou) are friendly, motivated and open-minded to work with. I wrote docs, technical/marketing materials and logic code samples for tutorials/sales pitching. Unfortunately, the company only managed to land a few sales over these years. We had our first layoff in Dec 2022, and then again in Jun 2024. As the fund exhausted, almost everyone left and the product development was thus stranded. I was asked to stay (again) but decide to quit as well.

This site is the refined and combined version of [Studio Guidebook](https://hackmd.io/@fstnetwork/BJboZp8Bc), [CLI Guidebook](https://hackmd.io/@fstnetwork/HyVeXrvIc) and [Agent List](https://hackmd.io/Uj-tC7l9Q82VyGr8R5PL2Q#Agent-List) that I've helped to create and maintain almost immediately after joining FST Network. This site is built with `React`-based [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), in which I also developed the coding tool [Logic Code Generator](/logic-code-generator) on my own with [`@monaco-editor/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@monaco-editor/react) and [`@rollup/browser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/browser), etc.
