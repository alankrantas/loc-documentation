# About This Site

Since this site is a preserved version of the docs I've been working on for two years, this page is a bit different from the official one.

FST Network was a nice, young and alive startup with an awesome working environment when I joined it in April 2022. I did believe in the product (it is indeed a genuine technical achievement itself) and thought it was actually good at what it was designed for. I worked alongside with devs and they were really happy to see the software they were building got to be properly documented. Occasionally, I help them debugging and can even find technological solutions for some issues.

Unfortunately, we never got more than a couple of sale deals, and we had our first layoffs in Dec 2022. Over half of the dev department was cut and we've moved to a smaller office.

The situation didn't improved much over the next year, and the second layoffs finally came in June 2024. I was asked to stay (again), but decided to quit. With the rest of the devs leaving, the product development left stranded, and the company stuck in a financial crisis, I don't think anything I do will change the tide. It was time to leave and find my next path.

Still, I wish good luck to FST Network and most of the colleagues I've worked with. It was a good memory and a kick-ass experience. I've learned so much and I'll never forget about it.
