# About This Site

:::note
Since this site is a archived version of the docs I've been working on for two years, this page is a bit different from the [official version](https://documentation.loc.fst.network/).

FST Network was a young, alive startup when I joined in April 2022. The product itself is indeed a technological feat, and the management people are friendly and open-minded to work with. I wrote docs, technical/marketing materials and logic code samples for tutorials/sales pitching. Unfortunately, the product only managed to land a few sales - we had our first layoff in Dec 2022, and then again in Jun 2024. Almost everyone left and the product development was stranded. I was asked to stay (again) but decide to quit as well.

This docs was the refined successor of several older docs: [Studio Guidebook](https://hackmd.io/@fstnetwork/BJboZp8Bc), [CLI Guidebook](https://hackmd.io/@fstnetwork/HyVeXrvIc) and [Agent List](https://hackmd.io/Uj-tC7l9Q82VyGr8R5PL2Q#Agent-List) that I've helped to create and maintain almost immediately after joining FST Network. This site is built with `React`-based [`Docusaurus`](https://docusaurus.io/), in which I also developed the coding tool [Logic Code Generator](/logic-code-generator) on my own with [`@monaco-editor/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@monaco-editor/react) and [`@rollup/browser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/browser), etc.
