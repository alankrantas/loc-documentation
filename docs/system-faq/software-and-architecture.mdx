# Software and Architecture

What software are used in LOC and how is the system structured?

## Architecture Overview

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img
        src={require("/img/system/loc-architecture.png").default}
        alt="loc-architecture"
    />
</div>

This is a _simplified_ architecture, but it shows how developers can deploy data processes serverlessly which in turn invoked by day-to-day users. The data processes use agents to operate external data as well as emit data events as data lineages.

:::info LOC Logic Runtime
The LOC runtime is responsible to execute logic defined in a data process and has its own dedicated resources.

Since LOC `v1.0`, LOC runtime supports running logic in different languages with swappable _external runtimes_.

## Software Technologies

The majority of LOC are proprietary software built by FST Network's developer team, mostly using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). All LOC components (except CLI) will run as custom resource (CR) pods in a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster.

However, we do recognize and relies on proven third party software and tools, most of them are open-sourced. Some notable ones include:

-   [Istio](https://istio.io/) (gateway and service mesh)
-   [KrakenD](https://www.krakend.io/) (gateway for API routes)
-   [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/) (trigger broker)
-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (internal storage)
-   [Redis](https://redis.io/) (internal storage)
-   [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Minio](https://min.io/) or S3-compatible databases (data process code and payload storage)
-   [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) (event store/data lineage)
-   [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/) (user interface for Elasticsearch)
-   [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) (performance/resource monitoring)
-   [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) (secrets management and protection)
-   [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) (local image registry)
-   [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/) (local NPM registry)

LOC SDKs are developed and published by FST Network, which are free to download locally.

## Supported Logic Languages

A LOC logic can be written in one of the following programming languages:

-   JavaScript
-   TypeScript
-   C# (C Sharp)

## Supported Data Sources

LOC data processes can be triggered by the following ways:

-   HTTP requests
-   Message queue messages
-   Scheduled jobs

LOC agents supports the following operating options (with more planned in each category):

-   HTTP endpoints
-   Databases:
    -   MySQL
    -   PostgreSQL
    -   Microsoft SQL Server
    -   Oracle Database
-   File storages:
    -   FTP
    -   S3
    -   SMB
-   SMTP email servers

With more can be request by clients and partners.
