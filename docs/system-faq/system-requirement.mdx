# System Requirements

Information in regard to LOC's system requirements.

## Infrastructure

The following table is the _recommended_ minimal requirement for running and operating a LOC instance:

| Item           | Spec                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU**        | 32 cores (24 for LOC and 8 for LOC runtime) |
| **RAM**        | 128 GB                                      |
| **Disk Space** | 1 TB SSD                                    |
| **OS**         | Ubuntu 20.04 (updated with latest patches)  |
| **Kubernetes** | v1.22+                                      |

The Kubernetes cluster should have at least 3 nodes for HA (High Availability). LOC's logic runtime will have its exclusive resources and can be expanded via license options.

A dedicated S3-compatible (for example, Amazon S3 or MinIO) storage is needed to serve as the logic repository. A Harbor service can also be installed as the container image registry, as well as a Verdaccio as the local NPM registry.

## Browser Compatibility for LOC Studio

LOC Studio is a web-based user interface. Below is some of the common browsers and their minimum required version (for the latest version):

| Browser                         | Minimum version         |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Google Chrome**               | 102.0.5005.63+ (64-bit) |
| **Mozilla Firefox**             | 101.0.1+ (64-bit)       |
| **Microsoft Edge** (on Windows) | 02.0.1245.39+ (64-bit)  |
| **Apple Safari** (on MacOS)     | 15.4+                   |

-   **Windows** (x86-64)
