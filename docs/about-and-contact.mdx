In FST Network (founded in 2018), we believe that federated data exchange and business process automation should and will exist commonly in the near future. It is our mission to bring forth a cutting-edge data network platform into the world, to connect the legacy to the next generation, to ensure security, enable collaboration, and work with ease.

The Logic Operating Centre is the brainchild of our founder, **Jack Chu**, with **Leo Chou** as the current Chief Product Officer.
