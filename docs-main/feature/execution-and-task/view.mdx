# Inspect Execution Result

To view execution results of one or more data processes.

## Execution Metadata and ID

Each execution has an unique ID (regardless of its execution status) which can be used for searching. The ID can be found from the response returned by a [trigger](/main/category/trigger) or can be copied directly from a [manual execution result](/main/feature/data-process/execute).

The following is an example of a JSON body of an API route response:

```json
{
    "_status": 200,
    "_metadata": {
        // highlight-next-line
        "executionId": "Y9oAGowUL-ALdKY7i6aljg",
        "triggerType": "ApiRoute",
        "triggerId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
        "creationTimestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z",
        "completionTimestamp": "2024-01-01T00:01:00.000000Z",
        "status": "Complete"
    },
    "data": {
        // combined task results
    }
}
```

:::info API Route Results
An asynchronous API route still returns execution and trigger metadata but will not wait for task results.

Only API routes will have the `_status` field, which can be configured using the result agent of the SDK. (Be noted that the `_status` field will always be `20x` in manual executions.)
:::

:::tip API Route Encapsulation
For API routes, the execution and trigger metadata can be omitted (only return task results if any) by [setting encapsulation to false](/main/feature/trigger/api-route#create-an-api-route).
:::

For manual execution results in Studio, the execution ID will also show up in the execution result window:

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img
        src={require("./img/Execution-result-manual.png").default}
        alt="Execution-result-manual"
    />
</div>

:::info
A manual execution result only contains the task result and the overall execution status.

You can inspect the full execution result in the [execution result](#inspect-an-execution-result) section.

## Execution Status

For each execution or task comes with an execution status:

import styles from "./css/execution-status.module.css";

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <span className={`big-font ${styles.success}`}>●</span> Complete
        </td>
        <td>
            An execution, task or logic had completed execution without errors
            or timeout.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <span className={`big-font ${styles.progress}`}>●</span> In Progress
        </td>
        <td>
            An execution is still running due to execution of one of the task or
            logic has not yet completed and timeout hasn't been reached.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <span className={`big-font ${styles.warn}`}>●</span> Timeout
        </td>
        <td>
            Execution time of one of the task had exceeded the data process'
            timeout limit (default: 180 seconds).
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>

            Error
        </td>
        <td>
            For an execution, it indicates one of the task had reported{" "}
            <code>Timeout</code>, <code>Complete with Error</code> or{" "}
            <code>System Error</code>.
        </td>
    </tr>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    For a logic, it indicates an error had been thrown in{" "}
                    <code>run()</code> (and <code>handleError()</code> had been
                    invoked).
                </li>
                <li>
                    For a task, it indicates a logic had reported{" "}
                    <code>Complete with Error</code> (and the aggregator logic
                    had invoked <code>handleError()</code> and may return a
                    different task result).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </td>
    </tr>

        </td>
        <td>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    For a logic, it indicates the logic cannot be executed due
                    to syntax errors, bundle errors (for native logic) or{" "}
                    <code>handleError()</code> had also threw an error.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For a task, it indicates one of the logic had reported{" "}
                    <code>System Error</code> and stopped the task (no task
                    results available).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <span className={`big-font ${styles.none}`}>●</span> Not Execute
        </td>
        <td>
            Logic had skipped execution due to one previous logic in the task
            had reported <code>System Error</code>.
        </td>
    </tr>

## Inspect an Execution Result

A full execution result includes metadata of the execution, its tasks as well as logs from each task.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="studio1" label="LOC Studio" default>

1. In LOC Studio, go to **Data Discovery** ➞ **Execution History**.

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/Nav-execution.png").default} alt="Nav-execution" />
</div>

2. Click on the trigger name of an execution result you are looking for.

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img
        src={require("./img/Execution-result-browse.png").default}
        alt="Execution-result-browse"
    />
</div>

3. The execution result contains metadata of the trigger and all of its tasks. You can copy <img src={require("./img/Copy.png").default} width="20px" alt="Copy" className="img-bg" /> PIDs or preview <img src={require("./img/View.png").default} width="20px" alt="View" className="img-bg" /> the execution trigger payload (if any), execution result or one of the task results.

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img
        src={require("./img/Execution-result.png").default}
        alt="Execution-result"
    />
</div>

4. Click the right arrow <img src={require("./img/Right.png").default} width="20px" alt="Right" className="img-bg" /> of a task to expand its logic.

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img
        src={require("./img/Execution-result-expanded.png").default}
        alt="Execution-result-expanded"
    />
</div>

5. By default, only the first log (if any) will be displayed. Click **Preview** <img src={require("./img/View.png").default} width="20px" alt="View" className="img-bg" /> behind a logic to inspect the full logs.

:::tip
Logs can be written using the logging agent of the SDK. See: [Logging Agent](/main/feature/agent/agent-list#logging-agent).

You can also click on a data process PID (permanent ID) to [inspect the data process](/main/feature/data-process/manage#browse-a-data-process), or click on a logic PID to inspect its [source code snapshot](/main/feature/logic/manage#inspect-a-logic).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Re-Execute a Task

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="studio2" label="LOC Studio" default>

If a task of an execution **failed to complete** due to some error, an **Re-execute** <img src={require("./img/CaretRight.png").default} width="20px" alt="CaretRight" className="img-bg" /> button will show up to allow you to [manually execute](/main/feature/data-process/execute) the data process again.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
