# Overview

An overview of the concept and purpose of LOC license.

## LOC License

As a product adopting the SaaS (Software as a Service) model, LOC - mainly LOC Core and LOC Studio - requires license to activate its usage.

A LOC license specify the following specifications:

-   Active state
-   Active period
-   Available infrastructure resources and their allocation for specific LOC features
-   Supported logic languages

The active state of your LOC instance can be updated by uploading a license file provided by FST Network.

### Active States
