# Overview

An overview of the concept and purpose of LOC agent configurations.

## What is an Agent Configuration?

> See: [Manage Configuration](/main/feature/agent-config/manage) and [Add Configuration to Data Process](/main/feature/agent-config/add-config)

An **agent configuration** is a mechanism to whitelist external data source hosts, as well as to hide connection information from the logic code themselves.

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    subgraph "LOC"
    subgraph "LOC runtime"
    subgraph "Task"
    n1[Logic];
    end
    n1-->n2;
    n2((Agents));
    end
    n2-.->|reference|n3;
    n3{{"Agent<br>Configuration"}}-.->|connection info|n4;
    n4([LOC gateway]);
    end
    n5[("External<br>storages")];
    n4-->|allow access|n5;
```

The following agents require at least an agent configuration to reference in a logic linked in a data process:

-   [HTTP Agent](/main/feature/agent/agent-list#http-agent) (for sending requests to HTTP endpoints)
-   [Database Agent](/main/feature/agent/agent-list#database-agent) (for database servers)
-   [File Storage Agent](/main/feature/agent/agent-list#file-storage-agent) (for file servers like FTP, SMB or S3)
-   [Mail Agent](/main/feature/agent/agent-list#mail-agent) (for SMTP servers)

## What is a Logic Variable?

A **logic variable** is an environment variable that can be attached to a logic, in the manner similar to an agent configuration.

In fact, a logic variable can be used to provide different configurations for a logic, for example, the reference name and HTTP endpoint path, so that you do not need to create additional logic to accommodate these details.
