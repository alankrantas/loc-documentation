:::tip Where Do I Start?
The main docs contains two major sections: **features** and **tutorials**.

The feature section covers important topics or functionalities in LOC, with concept overviews and step-by-step illustrated instructions for achieving certain actions. SDK-related topics will be referenced to the SDK docs (see below).

However, if you are a first time user, we recommend you to go over the tutorials first and by order. Each tutorial page has links pointing to corresponding feature pages. The tutorials will give you better ideas of how to build higher-level assets with various features.
