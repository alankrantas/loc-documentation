# Data Discovery

## Execution

For browsing and filtering execution histories of data processes in [tasks](/legacy/0.8/tutorials/loc-feat-overview#triggers-tasks-and-executions). For each task an execution contains logs (from [Logging Agent](/legacy/0.8/sdk-reference/logging)), trigger [payload](/legacy/0.8/sdk-reference/payload) as well as result (from [Result Agent](/legacy/0.8/sdk-reference/result)) from each task.

Click the plus sign (**+**) to expand the **Logic** sub panel, which will list logic PIDs and their logs.

    <img src={require("./img/execution.png").default} alt="execution" />
</div>

## Event

For browsing and filtering [events](/legacy/0.8/tutorials/loc-feat-overview#events) (emitted by [Event Store Agent](/legacy/0.8/sdk-reference/eventstore)). Each event includes label name, source DID, target DID, meta and time/task-related metadata.

:::tip
You can click **Event Lineage Graph** to inspect the data lineage graph. You can also filter events before doing so, to narrow down events you want to display.

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/event.png").default} alt="event" />
</div>

If you click an event by its label name or source/target DID, you will be switched to the **Label Name** or **DID** panels.

See the following tutorials of how to emit and inspect events/data lineages:

-   [Emit and Inspect Events](/legacy/0.8/tutorials/emit-and-inspect-event)
-   [Events and Multiple Data Processes](/legacy/0.8/tutorials/event-and-multiple-dp)
