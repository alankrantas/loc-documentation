# Introduction

LOC Studio is the web-based graphical user interface for LOC Core. Thanks to its highly-interactive Reack framework and UI/UX-driven design, Studio is intuitive to use and doesn't need a lot of walkthrough to learn. You've probably already used most of it in [Quick Start](/legacy/0.8/quickstart) and [Tutorials](/legacy/0.8/category/tutorials).
