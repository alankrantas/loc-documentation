# Release Note

LOC `v0.8` , as part of the ongoing effort focusing on better Studio/CLI synchronisation and logic modularisation, thus has brought some new major changes.

## Release Versions

| Component | Current Version |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Core      | `v0.8.0`        |
| Studio    | ` v1.3.0`       |
| CLI       | `v0.8.0`        |
| SDK       | `v0.8.0-1`      |

## Major New Features

### Summary

| New Feature                             | Summary                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Improved Studio/CLI Synchronisation** | Projects, scenarios and data processes deployed from Studio and CLI are now synced. |
| **Logic Modularisation**                | Logic are now built and now deployed as reusable modules for data processes.        |
| **Refactored CLI Workspace**            | See [Refactored CLI Workspace Structure](#refactored-cli-workspace-structure).      |

### Detailed List

-   Studio/CLI: logic are now built and deployed independently and to be added into data processes. This allows logic to be more reusable and in turn save development time.
-   Studio: the `run()` and `handleError()` functions in a logic created in Studio (_"cloud logic"_) is now stored together, just like the logic created in CLI workspace (_"source logic"_).
-   Studio: saves logic draft for cloud logic.
-   Studio: various improved or redesigned user interface, including the new logic and data process management features.
-   Studio: API route now uses projects (created for scenarios and data processes) as user's API route parent directory.
-   CLI: the project/scenario/data process structure is now fully synchronised in CLI workspaces.
-   CLI: the CLI executable binary is undergoing migrating from TypeScript to Rust with refactored commands and improved interactivity. The binary size is also cut down to only around 10~20 MB instead of 160+ MB.
-   CLI: [refactored CLI workspace directory structure](#refactored-cli-workspace-structure) to adopt the same project/scenario/data process hierarchy in Studio.
-   SDK: [HTTP Agent](/legacy/0.8/sdk-reference/http) (with related Tutorial) examples are now switched to `fetch` API.

### Refactored CLI Workspace Structure

> This is a breaking change for CLI even though logic code are mostly unaffected as in the previous release.

The workspace structure in CLI `v0.8.0` is refactored to reflect the changes of synchronisation and modularisation:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="change1-1" label="New (v0.8.0)" default>

Workspace structure is synced to Studio; the metadata of logic and projects/scenarios/data processes are now separated:

```
/[CLI workspace directory]
    /.loc
        /projects
            projects.yaml     <-- metadata of projects, scenarios and data processes
        logic-manifest.yaml   <-- metadata of logic
    /generic-logic-source
        logic-1.js
        logic-2.js
        logic-3.ts
        logic-4.ts
        ...
    /aggregator-logic-source
        aggregator-1.js
        aggregator-2.ts
        ...
    .locignore
    loc
    package.json
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="change1-2" label="Old (v0.7.0)">

Workspace is _data process-based_; each "project" (a Node.js project, not the Studio project) contains its own logic and config files:

```
/[CLI workspace directory]
    /data-process-1
        /generic-logic
            logic-1.js
            logic-2.js
            ...
        aggregator.js
        api-route-config.yaml
        config.yaml
        package.yaml
    /data-process-2
        /generic-logic
            logic-3.ts
            logic-4.ts
            ...
        aggregator.ts
        api-route-config.yaml
        config.yaml
        package.yaml
        tsconfig.json
    ...
    loc
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning
Since CLI `v0.8.0` binary is in the process of porting from TypeScript to Rust, it does not support the following features which was available in `v0.7.0`:

-   Tags and units
-   Triggers (API route, message queue and scheduler)
-   Agent configuration
-   Single data process execution
-   Local simple runtime
-   License

Related docs and references are also removed. We expect to add them back in the following releases.

### What's New in LOC-Doc?

-   Adds docs for Core/CLI/SDK `v0.8.x` and Studio `v1.3.x`.
-   Re-written [Quick Start](/legacy/0.8/quickstart) with [API route/execution history](/legacy/0.8/tutorials/create-api-route) moved to Tutorial.
-   Adds [LOC Features Overview](/legacy/0.8/tutorials/loc-feat-overview) in Tutorials
-   Tutorial logic examples are more modularised and hence more reusable. Some of the logic examples can also be found in [Logic Module Library](/legacy/0.8/category/logic-module-library).
-   Switch to using [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/) as HTTP clients in the docs.
-   Studio Guide page adjustments to reflect updated Studio interfaces.
-   Logic and other major resources are split to separate pages.
-   SDK TypeDoc docs (auto-generated from SDK) is removed (including `v0.7.0`) due to changes in SDK rendering incompatibility to TypeDoc.
-   Various improvements and fixes.
-   [Logic Code Generator](/logic-code-generator) - an experimental template tool for developing logic.
