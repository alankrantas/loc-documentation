# Workspace and Logic

CLI commands for managing assets in LOC:

-   Initialise CLI workspace
-   [Logic](#logic)

Also see:

-   [Create and Deploy Data Process](/legacy/0.9/cli-handbook/create-deploy-project)
-   [LOC Features Overview](/legacy/0.9/tutorials/loc-feat-overview)

:::info
Some commands require to be logged in the LOC server.

**Do not** manually edit anything under `/.loc` - use CLI commands to manage assets instead.
:::

## Initialise a CLI Workspace

```bash
loc init [WORKSPACE DIR]
```

Will create necessary sub-directories and files if not exist either under current directory or in a new directory (if `WORKSPACE DIR` is specified).

Will not overwrite files if existed.

## Logic

> `loc logic`

Logic are modulised functions which data processes are consisted of. The source code are managed in the form of script files.

### List All Logic

```bash
loc logic list|ls [--logic-type <LOGIC TYPE>] [--remote]
```

| Option                        | Description                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--logic-type <LOGIC TYPE>`\* | Logic type (`Generic` or `Aggregator`)                                                                           |
| `--remote`                    | List all remote logic on LOC server instead. If not provided, the local logic (deployed or not) would be listed. |

> \*= will be prompted if not provided

### Create a Logic

```bash
loc logic create|new [OPTIONS]
```

| Option                                | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--name <NAME>`\*                     | Logic name                                                                                   |
| `--logic-type <TYPE>`\*               | Logic type (`Generic` or `Aggregator`)                                                       |
| `--language <LANGUAGE>`\*             | Logic code language (`JavaScript` or `TypeScript`)                                           |
| `--entrypoint-file-path <FILENANE>`\* | Filename of the source logic (by default it would be `<logic name>.js` or `<logic name>.ts`) |

> \*= will be prompted if not provided

:::note
Generic logic source file will be generated under `/generic-logic-source/` and aggregator logic at `/aggregator-logic-source/`, with related metadata updated in `/.loc/logic-manifest.yaml`.

If a source file already exists while creating a logic, the file will not be overwritten.
:::

### Build and Deploy Logic

```bash
loc logic build [-a|--all] [logic names]
```

To build (compile) and upload logic to LOC server, which will become _native logic_.

| Option              | Description                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-a` &#124; `--all` | Build all logic in current workspace (overrides `logic names`) |
| `logic names`\*     | Names of logic to be built and deployed (seperated by spaces)  |

> \*= will be prompted if not provided

:::note
Deploying a new source logic will update its ID in `/.loc/logic-manifest.yaml`, whereas deploying a modified local logic will updates its revision number (ID unchanged).

A new revision of a deployed logic has to be manually linked (using [`loc dp edit`](/legacy/0.9/cli-handbook/cli-commands/project-dp#edit-a-data-process-including-linkingunlinking-logic)) into data processes to be used.

If a logic is already deployed, deploying the unmodified source logic will not create a new revision.

Only source files exists in `/.loc/logic-manifest.yaml` can be deployed.
:::

### Edit Logic Metadata

```bash
loc logic edit [--name <NAME>]
```

Edit name, description and filename of a logic (does not affect the source code file). CLI will prompt you for these options.

| Option          | Description                |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| `--name <NAME>` | Name of logic to be edited |

:::warning
Changing the logic name _does not_ change the file name.
:::

### Delete Logic

```bash
loc logic delete [--logic-type <LOGIC TYPE>] [--remote]
```

| Option                        | Description                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--logic-type <LOGIC TYPE>`\* | Logic type (`Generic` or `Aggregator`). Will be prompted by CLI if not provided.                                     |
| `--remote`                    | Delete remote logic on LOC server. If not provided, the local logic metadata (not the source file) would be deleted. |

> \*= will be prompted if not provided

:::note
A logic cannot be deleted if it is linked to any data process. Use [`loc dp edit`](/legacy/0.9/cli-handbook/cli-commands/project-dp#edit-a-data-process-including-linkingunlinking-logic) to unlink it and update the data process with [`loc project deploy`](/legacy/0.9/cli-handbook/cli-commands/project-dp#deploy-a-project-with-its-scenarios-and-data-processes).
