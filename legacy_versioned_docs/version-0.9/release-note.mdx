| **Logic Build History**                                 | A new log feature for inspecting all build/compile status of logic.                                                       |
| **Enhanced Studio Editor Support and Search Interface** | Code editor in Studio now supports SDK type checking and auto-formating on paste.                                         |
| **Support API Routes in Refactored CLI**                | Logic are now built and now deployed as reusable modules for data processes.                                              |
| **API Route Encapsulation**                             | You can now have API routes to return task results only (without execution metadata) by setting encapsulation to `false`. |
| **Studio Locales Support**                              | Studio now supports locales in Japanese (日本語) and Traditional Chinese (繁體中文).                                      |

### Detailed List

-   Studio: Data Discovery: drops "Label Name" and "DID" sub-panels under Event.
-   Studio: improved/simplify interface for searching and filtering assets (events, data processes and logic). You can now fuzzy search fields with only part of the string (case sensitive).
-   Studio: adds [Build History](/legacy/0.9/studio-guide/data-pipeline#build-history) under Data Pipeline panel, which shows build log of all cloud logic.
-   Studio: simplified logic draft system and user editing/building experience.
-   Studio: code editors now enables intellisense for SDK's type-checking in both JavaScript and TypeScript.
-   Studio: code editors now auto-formats code on paste. (You can still press hot keys to manually format the code.)
-   CLI: (re-)support commands for create, edit, deploy and delete [API routes](/legacy/0.9/cli-handbook/create-trigger) from a local CLI workspace.
-   CLI: initialising a workspace (command `loc init`) no longer require to logged in first and will not ask to sync from your remote project.
-   CLI: deletes a data process remotely will also delete the local data process metadata.
-   CLI: various improvements on error messages and prompts.
-   SDK: updates context [Task](/legacy/0.9/sdk-reference/context-and-task#task) interfaces while maintaining backward compatibility.

#### Studio `v1.4.1`

-   Studio: updates default logic code template for cloud logic.
-   Studio: adds two user interface locales: Japanese (日本語) and Traditional Chinese (繁體中文).

#### Studio `v1.4.2`

-   Studio: adds warning when deleting agent configurations that are used by data processes.
-   Studio: adds an indication if a referenced agent configuration in a data process has been deleted. LOC will also prevent you to execute a data process with missing agent configuration(s).

#### Studio `v1.4.3`

-   Studio: adds support for selecting API route encapsulation mode (whether or not to embed user's task result(s) in execution metadata).

### Refactored Task Interface

:::warning
Be noted that the deprecated interface `ctx.task.taskId` is still accessible in SDK `v0.9.0` for backward compatibility but will be removed sometime in the future.
:::

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="current" label="v0.9.0" default>

```typescript showLineNumbers
const taskId = ctx.task.taskKey.taskId;
const executionId = ctx.task.taskKey.executionId;
const taskStartTime = ctx.task.startTimestamp;
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="deprecated" label="v0.8.0 and earlier">

```typescript showLineNumbers
const taskId = ctx.task.taskId.id;
const executionId = ctx.task.taskId.executionId;
const taskStartTime = ctx.task.startAt;
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Studio Code Editor Intellisense

You can now inspect and check methods and parameter types of SDK classes in the code editor. JSDoc annotations will work as well.

### What's New in LOC-Doc?

-   Adds docs for Core/CLI/SDK `v0.9.x` and Studio `v1.4.x`.
-   Adds a tutorial: [Create a Data-Driven Microservice with Database](/legacy/0.9/tutorials/db-microservice).
-   Adds a use case (comprehensive tutorial): [Lakeside Oasis Café](/legacy/0.9/category/lakeside-oasis-cafe).
-   Displayed category title of all versioned Studio Guide docs now includes Studio versions for better recognition.
-   Various improvements and fixes.
-   In preparation for the future releases, LOC _resources_ in the docs are renamed to **features** or **assets** depending on the context, with _CLI workspace directory_ renamed to **local workspace**.
