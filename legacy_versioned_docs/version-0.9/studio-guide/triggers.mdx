# Triggers: API Route

For managing API routes, one of the most common [trigger](/legacy/0.9/tutorials/loc-feat-overview#triggers-tasks-and-executions) for invoking data processes. If multiple data processes are linked to an API route, they will be invoked _synchronously_.

See [Create and Use an API Route Trigger](/legacy/0.9/tutorials/create-api-route) for how to create an API route in Studio.

## Create an API Route

After creating a project in the Data Process panel or upload one via CLI, you can right-click the project in the API Route panel and click **Create API Route**.

An API route has the following options:

-   HTTP method
-   API path and prefix
-   Request mode (synchronous or asynchronous)
-   Response content type (auto, JSON, YAML or XML)
-   Encapsulation (whether or not to encapsulate task results in execution metadata; default `true`)
-   Linked data processes

:::note
A new created or modified API route would require a little time - several to a dozen seconds - to deploy or take effect (the gateway may return code `404` before the route is ready).

An API route returns one of the following HTTP code:

-   `200` indicates the (synchronous) API route has received an execution result within timeout (15 seconds).
-   `202` indicates the API route has triggered an execution but have not received the result (either the API is asynchronous or the execution did not finish due to some reason).

A synchronous API route may still return `202` if the data process(es) take more than 15 seconds to run, while still generate correct results in [execution history](/legacy/0.9/studio-guide/data-discovery#execution).

If you wish to return task result(s) only without the execution metadata (which means you can fully customise the API result), set the encapsulation to `false`, although you will not be able to retrace metadata like execution or task IDs.
:::

:::warning
If a data process has been linked to an API route, and you later create a new revision of the data process, you'll have to manually **re-link** it to the API route (modify the API route then link again).

If a linked data process contains missing [agent configurations](/legacy/0.9/studio-guide/agent-configuration), it won't be able to be executed.

Be noted that LOC gateway does not recognize additional path appended after an deployed API route. For example, when invoking an API route `/api/v1/my-service`, `/api/v1/my-service/{id}` would return `404`. You can use [QueryString](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) instead, for example, `/api/v1/my-service?id={id}`.
