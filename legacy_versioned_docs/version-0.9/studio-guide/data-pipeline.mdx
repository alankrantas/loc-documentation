# Data Pipeline: Logic and Data Process

## Data Process

Data processes are data pipelines created and run in LOC and are consisted of logic. You can browse them in **Explorer** (using the project hierarchy) or **Flat Search View** (as a list).

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/dataprocess.png").default} alt="dataprocess" />
</div>

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/dataprocess2.png").default} alt="dataprocess2" />
</div>

:::note
A data process is "deployed" once it was created. It would only be executed either invoked by triggers or to be run manually.

Modifying an existing data process creates a new revision.

You can delete a data process even though some logic are already linked to it.
:::

:::warning
A logic, after being linked into a data process, can setup its own [agent configuration](/legacy/0.9/studio-guide/agent-configuration) and logic variable. If a referenced agent configuration has been deleted (missing), LOC will prevent you from executing the data process until the missing agent configuration is removed or fixed.
:::

## Logic

[Logic](/legacy/0.9/tutorials/loc-feat-overview#data-process-and-logic) are code modules to be linked into one or more data processes.

Depends on how and where the logic are created, there are two types of logic can be browsed: [cloud logic and native logic](/legacy/0.9/tutorials/loc-feat-overview#cloud-logic-vs-native-logic). Only cloud logic are editable in Studio.

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/logic.png").default} alt="logic" />
</div>

You can view the logic code (all its revisions and draft) by clicking the logic name:

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/logic2.png").default} alt="logic2" />
</div>

The saved edited code of a logic before build is referred as the **draft**. You can create draft from any previous revisions.

You can save the draft by clicking the "âœ“" icon, or click the rocket (ðŸš€) icon to build it:

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/logic-build.png").default} alt="logic-build" />
</div>

If the logic did not compiled successfully, you can instect the error log:

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/logic-error.png").default} alt="logic-error" />
</div>

:::note
A logic is "deployed" once it was created. It has to be linked into a data process to be executed with it.

A logic cannot be deleted if it is linked to any data process.

Modifying an existing cloud logic or uploading a modified logic from CLI (native logic) creates a new revision.

You can add agent configuration and logic variables to a linked logic.
:::

## Build History

The logic build history is the log of building/compiling status of all cloud logic:

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/build-history.png").default} alt="build-history" />
</div>

:::note
The build logs of deleted logic (displayed in non-bold names) won't be removed.
