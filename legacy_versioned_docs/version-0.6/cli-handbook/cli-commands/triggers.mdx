# API Route, MQ and Scheduler

Triggers - API route, MQ and scheduler - CLI commands.

## API Route

> `loc apiroute|ar`

API routes can be set with `api-route-config.yaml` in the project, which defines the URL path that would be link to one or more data processes.

### Deploy an API Route

```bash
loc ar deploy -f <api-route-config>.yaml
```

The `pid` field in the YAML file must be set to a deployed data process's ID.

-   `-f`: API route YAML file (required)

:::tip
You can deploy an API route automatically along with a data process. See [Deploy a Project](/legacy/0.6/cli-handbook/cli-commands/project-dp-logic#deploy-a-project).
:::

### List All API Routes

```bash
loc ar list
```

### Inspect an API Route

```bash
loc ar get <id> -v
```

### Delete an API Route

```bash
loc ar delete <id>
```

## Message Queue

> `loc messagequeue|mq`

MQ sources can be set with **MQ client** YAML file, which defines the MQ client type, host and port. Both **MQ publisher** and **MQ subscriber** connect a MQ client with one or more data processes.

### Generate MQ Client YAML File

```bash
loc mq client init [output]
```

-   `output`: output file path and name (default: `message-queue-client.yaml`)

### Generate MQ Subscriber YAML File

```bash
loc mq sub init [output]
```

-   `output`: output file path and name (default: `subscriber.yaml`)

`clientId` in the file must be a deployed MQ client's ID.

### Generate MQ Publisher YAML File

```bash
loc mq pub init [output]
```

-   `output`: output file path and name (default: `publisher.yaml`)

`clientId` in the file must be a deployed MQ client's ID.

### Common MQ Commands

#### Deploy a MQ Asset

```bash
loc mq client|pub|sub deploy -f <mq-file>.yaml
```

If one MQ assets with the same name exists, it will be updated.

-   `-f`: MQ client/publisher/subscriber YAML file (required)

#### List All MQ Assets

```bash
loc mq client|pub|sub list
```

#### Inspect a MQ Assets

```bash
loc mq client|pub|sub get <id> -v
```

#### Delete a MQ Assets

```bash
loc mq client|pub|sub delete <id>
```

## Scheduler

> `loc scheduler|s`

A scheduler can be set with a **scheduled job** YAML file, which use a **trigger** (**schedule**) on one or more data processes.

:::info
The term _trigger_ is a bit confusing since we've already calling API routes, MQs and schedulers as _triggers_. The _schedule trigger_ will be officially renamed to `schedule` at next release.
:::

### Generate Schedule Trigger YAML File

```bash
loc s t init [-c|-t|-w] [output]
```

It can be specified as one of the following trigger/schedule type:

-   `-c`: a _Cron Job_ type trigger/schedule (default if no flag provided)
-   `-t`: a _TimeUnit_ type trigger/schedule
-   `-w`: a _Windowed TimeUnit_ type trigger/schedule (TimeUnit plus `startTimeOfDay` and `endTimeOfDay`)
-   `output`: output file path and name (default: `trigger.yaml`)

For a Cron job type schedule, the Cron expression has to have at least six fields.

### Generate Scheduled job YAML File

```bash
loc s sj init
```

-   `output`: output file path and name (default: `scheduled-job.yaml`)

`triggerId` in the file must be a deployed trigger/schedule's ID and `pid` set to a deployed data process' PID.

### Common Scheduler Commands

#### Deploy a Schedule Trigger/Scheduler Job

```bash
loc s t|sj deploy -f <scheduler-file>.yaml
```

-   `-f`: trigger YAML file (required)

:::note
If a trigger/schedule with the same name already exists, the `description`, `endTime` and `startTime` fields will be updated - but not the trigger/schedule type or time interval.

In other words, you need to _manually_ deploy a new trigger/schedule if you want to change the triggering schedule.
:::

#### List All Schedule Triggers/Scheduler Jobs

```bash
loc s t|sj list
```

#### Inspect a Schedule Trigger/Scheduler Job

```bash
loc s t|sj get <id> -v
```

#### Delete a Schedule Trigger/Scheduler Job

```bash
loc s t|sj delete <id>
```

Be noted that if a trigger/schedule is in use by a scheduled job, the scheduled job will be deleted as well.
