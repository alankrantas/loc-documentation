# Setup CLI

**LOC CLI** is the command line tool for developers to deploy data processes and manage other assets in LOC.

Also see [Command Reference](/legacy/0.6/category/cli-command-reference).

## Setup

### CLI Executable Binary

[FST Network](/docs/about-and-contact) provides **CLI executable binaries** to our clients, which is portable and can be used without any installation. The following platforms are supported:

-   Linux (64-bit)
-   macOS (64-bit)
-   Windows (64-bit)

:::info
This hankbook is based on CLI `v0.6.1` and LOC SDK `v0.6.4`.

The hand book also assumes that you have renamed your file to `loc` (or `loc.exe` in Windows), and copy it to a local directory (for example, `/CLI`).

We'll often refer this directory as **local workspace**. You can add the dir to the system variable `$PATH` if you want to access it globally.
:::

Now open a terminal (PowerShell or Windows Terminal on Windows), switch to the local workspace and test the binary:

```bash
./loc -h
```

:::tip
macOS and Linux users would have to mark the binary as executable:

```bash
sudo chmod a+x ./loc
```

:::

Or if you are using Command Prompt on Windows or accessing it via `$PATH`:

```bash
loc -h
```

You should see CLI print out a list of available commands.

### Local Development Environment

#### Node.js

Firstly you'll need to install **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** on your machine.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>

```bash
sudo apt install curl
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install nodejs
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

```bash
brew update
brew install node
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

Windows users can simply download the installer. (You do not have to check the option _"Automically install the necessary tools"_).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Docker Desktop

**Docker Desktop** is required only if you want to use the local simple runtime:

-   [Install on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
-   [Install on macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
-   [Instsll on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

#### Optional Tools

Some other tools are not absolute necessary but are recommended:

1. A code editor that supports JavaScript and TypeScript IntelliSense, for example, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with [JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next) installed.
2. Windows 10 users can also install [Windows Terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install) to replace Command Prompt and PowerShell.
3. A HTTP client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

    <summary><b>Tip</b> on developing in VS Code</summary>

1. Go to `File` -> `New Window`
2. Click `Open Folder...`
3. Select local workspace (the directory where the CLI binary is)
4. Open a new terminal with `Terminal` -> `New Terminal`. Now you can use CLI commands.

## Setting Up a Profile

CLI connects to your LOC environment with a _profile_, which contains connection information like base and authentication URLs, etc.

For any operations involving LOC festures and assets, you are also required to login with your LOC account.

:::info
To sign up, please contact your LOC Studio administrator. You'll receive an email with a temporary password (which you are required to change it by logging in _Studio_). You can use it for CLI login after that.

You can also use [Local Simple Runtime](/legacy/0.6/cli-handbook/local-runtime), which does not require an account.
:::

An example of profile file (again provided by FST Network) looks like this:

```yaml title="myprofile.yaml" showLineNumbers
baseURL: https://api.loc-***.fst.network
namespace: ********

ArthurL: https://auth.*****.fst.network/auth
realm: *****
clientId: loc-*****
```

<details>
    <summary><b>Tip</b> on creating blank files</summary>

You can either copy the profile from your team or create a blank file then copy/paste the content.

macOS and Linux users can do this with

```bash
touch <profile name>.yaml
```

Or (for Windows users)

```bash
type nul > <profile name>.yaml
```

Then open the file with an editor, copy/paste the profile and save it.

</details>

We recommend you to save profile files in a sub-directory like `/profiles`, which makes your file at `/profiles/myprofile.yaml`.

Then run the following command to setup your profile to CLI:

```bash
./loc p set -f ./profiles/myprofile.yaml -p myprofile
./loc p use myprofile
```

Now **myprofile** is setuped as your default profile. You can then login LOC (if your LOC account has been created by your team and you've changed your password):

```bash
./loc login
```
