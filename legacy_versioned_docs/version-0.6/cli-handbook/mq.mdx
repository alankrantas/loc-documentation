# Deploy MQ Client, Pub and Sub

Message queue **clients**, **publishers** and **subscribers** together are one of the trigger features that can be deployed and managed from CLI.

A MQ client can send messages to a data process via a MQ subscriber:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
     n1([MQ client])-->|subscribe|n2;
     n2[MQ Subscriber]-->|payload|n3[[Data process]];
```

---

Similarly, a data process can return results to the MQ client via a MQ publisher:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
     n3[[Data process]]-->|result|n4;
     n4[MQ Publisher]-->|publish|n5([MQ client]);
```

Both MQ subscriber and MQ publisher can be linked to a data process intependent of each other.

## MQ Client

A MQ client indicates the host and port of the MQ broker service.

Generate a MQ client template file:

```bash
./loc mq client init
```

```yaml title="message-queue-client.yaml" showLineNumbers
name: message-queue-client
description: message-queue-client
client:
    type: Kafka
    brokers:
        - host: 0.0.0.0
          port: 9092
```

:::note
For now only Apache Kafka is supported.
:::

Deploy the MQ client:

```bash
./loc mq client deploy -f message-queue-client.yaml
```

## MQ Subscriber and Publisher

Once the MQ client is deployed, find out its permanent ID with

```bash
./loc mq client list
```

Then generate template files for MQ subscriber and publisher:

### Subscriber

```bash
./loc mq sub init
```

```yaml title="subscriber.yaml" showLineNumbers
name: mq-subscriber
description: mq-subscriber
# highlight-next-line
clientId: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
dataProcessPids:
    # highlight-next-line
    - pid: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
      revision: latest
consumer:
    type: Kafka
    topic: example-topic
```

:::note
For now, any incoming messages will trigger linked data processes. You can read the message topics or other information via the [MQ payload](/legacy/0.6/sdk-reference/payload#message-queue-payload) in logic.
:::

### Publisher

```bash
./loc mq pub init
```

```yaml title="publisher.yaml" showLineNumbers
name: mq-publisher
description: mq-publisher
# highlight-next-line
clientId: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
dataProcessPids:
    # highlight-next-line
    - pid: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
      revision: latest
producer:
    type: Kafka
    topic: example-topic
```

You have to modify both with the correct `clientId` (MQ client PID), data process PIDs, MQ type as well as message topic.

### Deploy

Then deploy the MQ subscriber and publisher:

```bash
./loc mq sub deploy -f subscriber.yaml
./loc mq pub deploy -f publisher.yaml
```
