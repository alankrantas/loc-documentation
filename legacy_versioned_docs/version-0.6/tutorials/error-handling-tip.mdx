# Tips on Error Handling

Some tips about handling errors in logic.

> This tutorial uses JavaScript and assume you are using [LOC Studio](/legacy/0.6/category/studio-guide).

## How Logic Handle Errors

In [Logic and Session](/legacy/0.6/tutorials/logic-and-session) we've mentioned that each logic has a `handleError` function for error handling. This is how it works:

-   LOC execute the `run` function of a logic. If `run` runs successfully, execute the `run` of next logic.
-   If `run` throws an error, `handleError` in the same logic will be called.
-   All `handleError` of the rest of logic (including aggregator) will be called. The original error will be passed down all the way to aggregator.

| Logic      | Executed function                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Generic #1 | `run` ✅                                |
| Generic #2 | `run` ❌ error thrown! -> `handleError` |
| Generic #3 | `handleError`                           |
| ...        | `handleError`                           |
| Aggregator | `handleError`                           |

In other words, if one logic fails, _the rest of the logic will fail_. This is to prevent a data pipeline causing more damage even after something went wrong. The data process task will still finish normally, but also considered to be failed.

## Return Error with Result Agent

In many examples we use the [logger agent](/legacy/0.6/sdk-reference/logging) to log error messages. However, these logs are not visible in normal data process operations.

So one of the good practices is to return the error - if there are any - using [result agent](/legacy/0.6/sdk-reference/result):

```javascript showLineNumbers
// in aggregator logic
async function handleError(ctx, error) {
    ctx.agents.result.finalize({
        status: "error",
        taskId: ctx.task.taskId,
        error: error.message,
        // any other session data you'd like to send
    });
}
```

You can even have logic report status or errors using session storage agent, then have the aggregator return them at once (see next section).

:::tip
Due to the nature of how LOC run logic, sometimes it's not easy to find out where exactly did the error happened. In these cases we recommend you to use `try...catch` to isolate the issue (see next sections).
:::

## Use Try...Catch...Finally to Handle Errors

There may be situations that you want the rest of logic to carry on despite errors have occurred, or to recover from _expected_ errors. In this case you can use `try...catch...finally`:

```javascript showLineNumbers
try {
    // normal code
} catch (e) {
    // handles error
    ctx.agents.logging.error(`an error ${e.name} has occurred: ${e.message}`);
} finally {
    // optional; do things whether or not errors have occurred
}
```

## Pass Error to Aggregator Logic Using Session

If you cannot access logs or use [Local Simple Runtime](/legacy/0.6/cli-handbook/local-runtime), one trick you can try is to wrap up possible sections with `try...catch` and have them pass error to the aggregator, then output everything via the trigger.

```javascript showLineNumbers
// in one of the generic logic
try {
    // ...
} catch (e) {
    // generate error message
    const logic1_err = {
        logicName: "Generic Logic #1",
        errorName: e.name,
        errorMsg: e.message,
        // other info you want to add
    };

    // log error
    ctx.agents.logging.error(logic1_err);

    // pass info to aggregator
    await ctx.agents.sessionStorage.putJson("logic1_err", logic1_err);
}
```

```javascript showLineNumbers
// aggregator logic
const err = await ctx.agents.sessionStorage.get("logic1_err"); // read the error
// ...

ctx.agents.result.finalize({
    status: "error",
    taskId: ctx.task.taskId,
    logic1_err: logic1_err, // pass error to user
    // ...
});
```

The user will be able to see what kind of errors had occurred in which logic.

## Manually Throw an Error to Stop Data Process

In some cases there's nothing wrong with the code, but you may need to stop the data process using invalid or incorrect data to do something it shouldn't.

If so, you can deliberately throw an error to force LOC fall back to the `handleError` mechanism:

```javascript showLineNumbers
throw new Error("Oh no, not again."); // invoke handleError on purpose
```
