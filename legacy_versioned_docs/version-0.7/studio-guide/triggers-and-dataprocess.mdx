# Triggers and Data Process

This is the developer's sections for deploying and managing user assets:

-   Triggers:
    -   API Route
-   Data processes

:::info
Studio does not yet support managing message queue and scheduler triggers.
:::

## API Route

For managing API routes, one of the most used trigger for data processes.

See [Quick Start](/legacy/0.7/quickstart#create-an-api-route) for how to create an API route in Studio.

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/apiroute.png").default} alt="apiroute" />
</div>

:::tip
A new created API route would need a bit time to take effect (the gateway returns `404` before the route is ready).

If a data process has been linked to an API route, and you later undeploy the data process to update it, you'll have to manually **re-link** it to the API route (modify the API route then link again).

If multiple data processes are linked to an API route, they will be invoked _synchronously_.
:::

## Data Process - DP Interactive Map

For managing units, scenarios, data processes and logic, tag, revision info in them. You can drag, zoom or inspect the detail of the logic blocks.

See [Quick Start](/legacy/0.7/quickstart#create-a-project-and-a-scenario) for how to deploy a data process in Studio.

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/dpmap.png").default} alt="dpmap" />
</div>

:::tip
Anything in a data process _can only be modified_ when it's undeployed.

The data process' revision number will add `1` after being updated. If you edit a data process created by someone else, they will receive an notification email. You can also add new comments as update logs while editing a logic.

:::note
For now only one unit `Default` is supported in Studio and cannot be changed.
