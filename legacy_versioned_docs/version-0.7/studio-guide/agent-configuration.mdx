# Agent Configuration

**Agent Configuration** is part of the administration panel for creating and managing secrets for the following agents in [SDK](/legacy/0.7/category/sdk-reference):

-   [HTTP agent](/legacy/0.7/sdk-reference/http)
-   [Database agent](/legacy/0.7/sdk-reference/database)
-   [File storage agent](/legacy/0.7/sdk-reference/filestorage)
-   [Mail agent](/legacy/0.7/sdk-reference/mail)

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img
        src={require("./img/agent-configuration.png").default}
        alt="agent-configuration"
    />
</div>

To create a configuration, first create a folder if there is none, then right-click the folder to create a new configuration. Once set, agents would be able to access these configurations by name.

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img
        src={require("./img/agent-configuration2.png").default}
        alt="agent-configuration2"
    />
</div>

See [tutorial](/legacy/0.7/tutorials/http-agent-configuration) and [CLI handbook](/legacy/0.7/cli-handbook/create-deploy-project#agent-configuration) for how to use agent configurations in your data processes.

:::warning
Configuration name cannot not have space.

Also be noted that logic created in Studio _can only_ access agent configurations created in Studio (config deployed by CLI can only be used by CLI projects).

:::info
In future releases the agent configuration panel can only be seen by LOC Owners.
