# User Management

User management is a KeyClock service with a seperate endpoint; please consult FST Network for the actual link and information.

Only members who have managing privilege can create new users. An existing email should be used. One important detail is to switch on the **Temporary** option - the user will receive a temporary, random password via email. After login Studio for the first time the user would be prompted for a new password.

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/account.png").default} alt="account" />
</div>

:::note
Future releases of Studio will have a integrated user management system in Studio.
