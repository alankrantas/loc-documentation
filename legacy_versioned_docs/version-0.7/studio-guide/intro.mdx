# Introduction

LOC Studio is the web-based graphical user interface for LOC Core. Thanks to its highly-interactive Reack framework and UI/UX-driven design, Studio is intuitive to use and doesn't need a lot of walkthrough to learn. You've probably already used most of it in [Quick Start](/legacy/0.7/quickstart) and [Tutorials](/legacy/0.7/category/tutorials).

:::info
This section is currently based on Studio `v1.2.1`. LOC Studio can be used on most of web browsers without any additional installation (the URL depends on your actual LOC instance).

Supported logic code languages/version:

-   JavaScript `ES6/ES2015` and above
