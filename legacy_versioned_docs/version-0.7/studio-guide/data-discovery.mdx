# Data Discovery

**Data Discovery** is the data/metadata catelog for browsing assets and logs in LOC Core:

-   Execution history (including tasks)
-   Data events and data lineage graph
-   Logic and data processes

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/studio.png").default} alt="studio" />
</div>

## Execution

Browse execution histories of data processes (tasks). Each task contains logs (from [Logging Agent](/legacy/0.7/sdk-reference/logging)), trigger [payload](/legacy/0.7/sdk-reference/payload) as well as result (from [Result Agent](/legacy/0.7/sdk-reference/result)) from the logic.

Click an execution ID and you can view logics with their task logs: invoked agent functions and results returned by the result agent.

Click the plus sign (**+**) to expand the **Logic** sub panel, which will list logic PIDs and their logs.

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/execution.png").default} alt="execution" />
</div>

## Event

Browse data events. The logs includes basic fields of an event and when/where it was emitted.

:::tip
You can click **Event Lineage Graph** to see the data lineage graph. You can also filter events before doing so, to narrow down events you want to display.

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/event.png").default} alt="event" />
</div>

If you click an event by its label name or source/target DID, you will be switched to the **Label Name** or **DID** panels.

See the following tutorials of how to emit and inspect events/data lineages:

-   [Emit and Inspect Events](/legacy/0.7/tutorials/emit-and-inspect-event)
-   [Events and Multiple Data Processes](/legacy/0.7/tutorials/event-and-multiple-dp)

## Logic

Browse logic, including tags, event schema (if detected) and who and when creates them.

## Data Process

Browse data processes, including tags and who and when creates them.
