# Source Control with Git

Although CLI does not offer version control, you can use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to upload data processes to a Gitbub repository and shared with other team members.

There are _many ways_ to use Git and you can check out the [official documentation](https://git-scm.com/legacy/0.7/gittutorial). Here we'll give you one of the most basic example.

:::tip
If you are developing with VS Code, you can also use the built-in source control functionalities. See: [Using Git source control in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/legacy/0.7/sourcecontrol/overview).
:::

## First Commit

The following instruction is for the first person to create and upload some data processes (and maybe some shared libraries).

Create a `.gitignore` under your local workspace:

```plain title="/[local workspace]/.gitignore" showLineNumbers
.DS_Store
./node_modules
./local-runtime
./profiles
loc
loc.exe
package-lock.json
yarn.lock
*.yaml
**/build
**/node_modules
**/package-lock.json
**/yarn.lock
**/.deploy-info.json
# any other subdirectories and projects you want Git to ignore
```

:::note
Anything in `.gitignore` will be ignored by Git. Here we assume profile files are stored in `profiles`, local runtime-related files are in `local-runtime`. Remove them if you want to include them for version control.
:::

Then create a new Github repository without `README.md` and any branch, and run the following terminal commands from the local workspace:

1. Initialize your local workspace with Git.
2. Add all files to index.
3. Create the `main` branch.
4. Add the Github repo as remote origin.
5. Push changes in index to `main` branch of the repo.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<Github account>/<repo name>.git
git push -u origin main
```

:::info
The HTTPS URL above can be found by clicking `Code` on the repository page.

Git will prompt for your Github account and password for the first time operating remote assets.
:::

## Basic Collaboration

After the first commit, you or anyone else in the team can download the repository and commit new changes.

First clone the repository and add the commit target:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<Github account>/<repo name>.git
git remote add origin https://github.com/<Github account>/<repo name>.git
```

Then whenever you've made changes and are ready to commit, use the following terminal commands in your local workspace:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git pull origin main
git push origin <branch>
```

`<branch>` is a seperate branch other than `main`. Create a pull request (PR) so your commit can be reviewed by someone in your team before merging.

:::tip
It is recommended to specify what has been commited in the commit message.
