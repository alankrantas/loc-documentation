# Project, Data Process and Logic

CLI commands for managing projects, data processes and logic.

## Project

### Create New Template

```bash
loc new [-ts] <project name>
```

-   `-ts`: for TypeScript project

### Deploy a Project

```bash
loc deploy [-ts] <project dir name> [-ar]
```

-   `-ts`: for TypeScript project
-   `-ar`: deploy api-route-config.yaml in the project, automatically match the data process permanent ID and delete the existing API route.

Any new tags in `config.yaml` will be added into LOC. A new file `.deploy-info.json` will be generated in the project dir once the data process is successfully deployed, which records history of logic and data process PIDs related to this project.

### Remove Deployed Projects

```bash
loc delete <project dir name>
```

This command will refer to `.deploy-info.json` and try to remove _all_ deployed assets in this file (data processes, logic, API route) from LOC.

:::tip
This is a short cut to quickly "undeploy" old data processes from CLI, perfect for the developing stage - but use it with caution after your data process is "in production".
:::

## Data Process

> `loc dataprocess|dp`

### List All Data Processes

```bash
loc dp list [-A] [-s]
```

List all data processes in LOC with their permanent IDs. The data processes will be sorted by name (case insensitive) unless a different sort option is provided.

-   `-A`: list all versions
-   `-s`: sort option: `name` (default), `pid` or `timestamp`

#### Example

```bash
loc dp list
loc dp list -A
loc dp list -s timestamp
```

### Search Data Processes

```bash
loc dp search [-t <tag name>|--tag-id <permanent id>|--pid <permanent id>] [-s]
```

The search condition, if not specified, will be a data process name.

Or one of the following option can be specified: a tag name, a tag permanent ID or a data process permanent ID.

The data processes will be sorted by name (case insensitive) unless a different sort option is provided.

-   `-t`: search with tag name
-   `--tag-id`: search with tag permanent ID
-   `--pid`: search with data process permanent ID
-   `-s`: sort option: `name` (default), `pid` or `timestamp`

#### Example

```bash
loc dp search <data process name>
loc dp search -t <tag>
loc dp search -t <tag> -s timestamp
loc dp search --tag-id <tag id>
loc dp search --pid <permanent id>
```

### Inspect a Data Process

```bash
loc dp get <permanent id> -v
```

View details of a data process (including logic, tag and unit permanent IDs).

### Delete a Data Process

```bash
loc dp delete <permanent id>
```

### Single Data Process Execution

```bash
loc dp run -f <run-task.yaml>
```

Run a deployed data process as single execution. The data processes' PIDs and revision are specified in `run-task.yaml` (which can be generated with `loc dp run-init`); See [Single Data Process Execution](/legacy/0.7/cli-handbook/single-execution) for details.

-   `-f`: payload file (JSON or YAML)

### Local Simple Runtime Execution

```bash
loc dp run-local [-ts] <project dir> -f <payload.yaml> [--docker|--export]
```

Use with [Local Simple Runtime](/legacy/0.7/cli-handbook/local-runtime). A local runtime binary or its container image must be present on the local machine.

-   `-ts`: for TypeScript projects
-   `-f`: payload file (JSON or YAML)
-   `--docker`: use docker mode (otherwise use binary file)
-   `--export`: only export preset task and data process config, in `/<project name>/build/preset-task.yaml` (no data process will run)

### Initialise Execution Config Files

```bash
loc dp run-init
```

Generate a task cnofig file for either Single Data Process Execution (`run-task.yaml`) or Local Simple Runtime (`run-local-task.yaml`). The command will prompt for the file type.

## Logic

> `loc logic|l`

### List All Logic

```bash
loc l list [-g] [-a] [-A] [-s]
```

-   `-g`: show generic logic
-   `-a`: show aggregator logic (default)
-   `-A`: list all revisions
-   `-s`: sort option: `name` (default), `pid` or `timestamp`

`loc l -g -a` will return both generic and aggregator logic. If no flag is provided, only aggregator logic will be returned.

The logic will be sorted by name (case insensitive) unless a different sort option is provided.

### Search Logic

```bash
loc l search [-g|-a -t <tag name>|--tag-id <permanent id>|--pid <permanent id>] [-s]
```

The search condition, if not specified, will be logic names.

Or one of the following option can be specified: tag names, tag PIDs or a logic permanent IDs.

-   `-t`: search with tag name(s)
-   `--tag-id`: search with tag permanent ID(s)
-   `--pid`: search with logic permanent ID(s)
-   `-s`: sort option: `name` (default), `pid` or `timestamp`

#### Example

```bash
loc l search -g <logic name 1>,<logic name 2>...
loc l search -g -t <tag name 1>,<tag name 2>...
loc l search -g -t <tag name 1>,<tag name 2>... -s timestamp
loc l search -g --tag-id <tag id 1>,<tag id 2>...
loc l search -a --pid <permanent id 1>,<permanent id 2>...
```

### Inspect a Logic

```bash
loc l get -g|-a <permanent id>
```

One of the following flag has to be provided:

-   `-g`: the logic is generic logic
-   `-a`: the logic is aggregator logic

#### Example

```bash
loc l get -g <permanent id>
loc l get -a <permanent id>
```

### Compile a Logic

:::info
For developing and testing purpose only
:::

```bash
loc l build [-ts] <input file> -o <output file> [--minify]
```

Compile a local JavaScript or TypeScript source file.

-   `-ts`: for TypeScript source file
-   `--minify`: minify code
-   `-o`: output file path/name

### Delete a Logic

:::warning
Not recommended to use
:::

```bash
loc l delete <permanent id>
```

### Purge All Unused Logic

:::warning
Not recommanded to use
:::

```bash
loc l prune g|a [--dry-run]
```

Delete all unused generic or aggregator logic in LOC (will ask for confirmation).

-   `g`: generic logic
-   `a`: aggregator logic
-   `--dry-run`: do not do anything; only returns logic that will be purged without this flag
