</div>

There are four stages of licensing status:

| Status           | Display color | LOC feature available period     |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Inactive         | Red           | Not available                    |
| Trial            | Blue          | 30 days                          |
| Active           | Green         | Depending on your purchased plan |
| Active (Expired) | Yellow        | 45 days                          |

You will get the following notification if your license is expired:

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/expired.png").default} alt="expired" />
</div>

You can update your license with a file containing valid, encrypted activation code either in this Studio panel. The activation code remains valid and can be updated repeatly before being expired.
