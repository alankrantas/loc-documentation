# Data Discovery: Execution History and Events

## Execution

For browsing and filtering **execution histories**, each record represents one execution from one trigger which contains at least one [tasks](/legacy/0.10/tutorials/loc-feat-overview#triggers-tasks-and-executions). Each task contains logs (from [Logging Agent](/legacy/0.10/sdk-reference/logging)), trigger [payload](/legacy/0.10/sdk-reference/payload) as well as task result (from [Result Agent](/legacy/0.10/sdk-reference/result)) from each task.

Click the trigger name to inspect the details, from which you can expand the list of logic and their logs.

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/execution.png").default} alt="execution" />
</div>

See [View Execution History](/legacy/0.10/tutorials/create-api-route#view-execution-history) in one of the tutorial for more details.

### Execution Status

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <span className="big-font success-color">●</span> Complete
        </td>
        <td>
            An execution, task or logic had completed execution without errors
            or timeout.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <span className="big-font progress-color">●</span> In Progress
        </td>
        <td>
            An execution is still running due to execution of one of the task or
            logic has not yet completed and timeout hasn't been reached.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <span className="big-font warn-color">●</span> Timeout
        </td>
        <td>
            Execution time of one of the task had exceeded the data process'
            timeout limit (default: 180 seconds).
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <span className="big-font error-color">●</span> Execution Error
        </td>
        <td>
            For an execution, it indicates one of the task had reported{" "}
            <code>Timeout</code>, <code>Complete with Error</code> or{" "}
            <code>System Error</code>.
        </td>
    </tr>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    For a logic, it indicates an error had been thrown in{" "}
                    <code>run()</code> (and <code>handleError()</code> had been
                    invoked).
                </li>
                <li>
                    For a task, it indicates a logic had reported{" "}
                    <code>Complete with Error</code> (and the aggregator logic
                    had invoked <code>handleError()</code> and may return a
                    different task result).
                </li>

        </td>
        <td>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    For a logic, it indicates the logic cannot be executed due
                    to syntax errors, bundle errors (for native logic) or{" "}
                    <code>handleError()</code> had also thrww an error.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For a task, it indicates one of the logic had reported{" "}
                    <code>System Error</code> and stopped the task (no task
                    results available).
                </li>

        </td>
        <td>
            Logic had skipped execution due to one previous logic in the task
            had reported <code>System Error</code>.
        </td>
    </tr>

## Event

For browsing and filtering [events](/legacy/0.10/tutorials/loc-feat-overview#events) (emitted by [Event Store Agent](/legacy/0.10/sdk-reference/eventstore)).

Each event - a persistent "log" with metadata including label name, source DID, target DID, meta payload and time/task-related fields - can be queried for various purposes.

See the following tutorials of how to emit and inspect events/data lineages:

-   [Emit and Inspect Events](/legacy/0.10/tutorials/emit-and-inspect-event)
-   [Events and Multiple Data Processes](/legacy/0.10/tutorials/event-and-multiple-dp)

### Event Lineage Graph

After filtering events, you can click **Event Lineage Graph** to inspect the graphical result of data lineage:

<div className="center-padded-sm">
    <img src={require("./img/event.png").default} alt="event" />
</div>

If you click an event by its label name or source/target DID, you will be switched to the **Label Name** or **DID** panels.
