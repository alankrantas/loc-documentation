# Legacy Docs Portal

Started from LOC Core `v1.0` and Studio `v2.0`, the LOC Documentation has been refactored to support multiple docs versioning to better accommodate the future release roadmaps, as well as to streamline the effort of users looking up subjects.

Read the latest docs [here](/docs).

The following legacy docs are available:

-   [`0.10`](/legacy/0.10/intro) ([release note](/legacy/0.10/release-note))
-   [`0.9`](/legacy/0.9/intro) ([release note](/legacy/0.9/release-note))
-   [`0.8`](/legacy/0.8/intro) ([release note](/legacy/0.8/release-note))
-   [`0.7`](/legacy/0.7/intro) ([release note](/legacy/0.7/release-note))
-   [`0.6`](/legacy/0.6/intro) ([release note](/legacy/0.6/release-note))
